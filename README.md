# GZDoom-VR 
Based on gz3doom (http://rotatingpenguin.com/gz3doom/), OpenVr Doom https://github.com/Fishbiter/gz3doom and QuestZDoom https://github.com/DrBeef/QuestZDoom

The aim of this fork is to update base GZDoom version.

Built/tested on HP Reverb and Oculus Quest using Virtual Desktop but other VR setups should work as long they are compatible with OpenVR API.

This build exposes OpenVR controller input for definition (you will need to define the controls).
One hand (right by default) is tracked for the weapon. I have included two modified weapon packs authored by Fishbiter.
